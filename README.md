## Day 1: Brainstorming Blitz and Unveiling the Problem

At 10:00 AM sharp, our journey began with a whirlwind of creative energy. Fueled by coffee and determination, we selected a problem statement that guided our 36-hour odyssey. Our Eureka moment came two hours in, setting the tone for the rest of the competition.

## Navigating the Jury Seas: Insights and Pivots

The afternoon brought our first encounter with the jury â€“ seasoned veterans offering invaluable insights and dissecting the complexities of the challenge. The following seven hours were a blur of focused execution, crafting a roadmap for the next 18 hours. The jury evaluation at 7:00 PM revealed crucial gaps in our approach.

## Refining the Prototype: Round Two with the Masters

Four hours later, the jury returned with laser-sharp feedback. Round 2 of the "mentoring session" provided the ammunition we needed to refine our approach. By Day 2's 9:00 AM, our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stood proudly, with the only hurdle being the integration of an iodine device, seamlessly bridged by NextJS.

## The Final Push: From Code to Showcase

With just 4-5 hours to the finish line, adrenaline levels peaked. Every discussion, every code stroke carried the weight of culmination. We fine-tuned the integration, honed the showcase narrative, and prepared to face the final jury.

## The Verdict: Beyond the Trophy

While the coveted trophy eluded us, the victory was far greater. We learned to build scalable websites, master design techniques, integrate devices, model data, deploy databases, and navigate the nuances of cloud scaling. This journey was a masterclass in grit, growth, and collaboration.
